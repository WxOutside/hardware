# Hardware

This is a guide on how to create a solar-powered weather station. It includes all the hardware details and the specific components you need, plus the software you need to run it.

Based on real in-the-field experience, this combination of hardware will last in rainy/heavily overcast weather for roughly 2.5 days. Where I live, this will mostly likely be a problem around the winter solstice and spring-time, when the weather gets quite volatile.

This guide is still under construction as components get tested and better options are discovered. If you think there are better components to consider, or the configuration could be improved, please get in touch:
